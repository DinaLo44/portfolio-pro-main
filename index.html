        <p>I am originary from Tamaulipas, Mexico, where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in International Relations 
        from the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas in 2007. In 2009 I was hired by the Mexican government to work at 
        the Consular office in Salt Lake City, Utah, which has been one of the best experiences in my life!. After working 
        for 8 years I decided to quit in order to take care of my first son. Then I realized I needed to find a job that would
        give me flexible hours and the opportunity to work from home. A few months later I found a remote job in a paralegal firm, 
        where I worked for almost 4 years.<br><br>At the beginning of 2022, I decided to start a new episode in my career and decided to enroll in Salt Lake Community College in the Computer
        Science program. I have always liked computers and technology but I had not given myself a chance to learn more about it and finally
        this year I took the decision to follow that path. However, I realized it would take a long time in order to get my
        Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science as a part-time student. Because of that, I wanted to give a try to the Coding Boot Camp to 
        introduce myself in the industry at a faster pace.</p>
