# portfolio-pro-main

This project consisted in creating a profesional portfolio where I could introduced myself, show a little bit of web development work I have done and a section with my contact information.

-The "About Me" section focuses in the experience and jobs I have been in during the last 12 years. 

-The "Work" section included three small projects I developed as part of the Coding bootcamp prework. The first project consisted in a platform that will link viewers to informative sites in order to learn more about outdoor activities and places Utah offers. 

 The second application is a fan page that informs about the "Backstreet Boys" band. The website diplays the history of the band, names, ages and places of birth for all  members, among other facts.

 The third and last application it is a simple demostration of basic JavaScript functions.


-Finally the "Contact Me" section displays what it could be my phone number, and then my real my personal email and a link to my GitHub site.

Here is a screenshot of the final website:
